      <description>Mental Reset In the time period between my last post and this, I did a bunch of things. Some of them dumb, some of them cool and most of them unnecessary. I’m proud of all of them nonetheless (but ofc I won’t talk about the dumb ones)&#xA;I learned go. It is a pleasant language. Not amazing, not bad, good. Using go, I then proceeded to redo the backend of this blog.</description>

      <description>As far as I understand, there are 2 ways to live.&#xA;[!note]&#xA;ik False Dilemma . But bear with me I wrote this a while ago and I swear I have somthing to say.&#xA;With ambition and without ambition. With dreams, like every other shonen protagonist and like Denji.&#xA;I am halfway through Chainsaw Man , and it has moved me to an extent where I am forced to rethink how I view my life as a whole.</description>

      <description>3B1B: Essence of Linear Algebra 1: Vectors 3 main ideas surrounding vectors.&#xA;vectors - arrows pointing in space - has length and directon position does not matter can be 2D and 3D. vectors - ordered list of numbers - i.e vector fancy word for list last one i dont resonate with but here it is regardless. i dont really get it ig.&#xA;vectors - can be anything as long as there is an addition and a multiplication operation possible.</description>

      <description>Knobs Temperature: higher value -&amp;gt; more deterministic output. lower value -&amp;gt; more creative output (higher chances of hallucination?). essentially increasing the weights of other possible tokens! as temperature decreases. so obv for fact based questions -&amp;gt; lower temp, for creative tasks -&amp;gt; higher temp Top_p: controls how deterministic the model is at generating responses! treat almost the same way as temperature. The general recommendation is to alter one, not both.</description>
