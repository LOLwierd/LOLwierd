## 3B1B: Essence of Linear Algebra

### 1: Vectors
3 main ideas surrounding vectors.
- vectors - arrows pointing in space - has length and directon position does not matter can be 2D and 3D.
- vectors - ordered list of numbers - i.e vector fancy word for list

last one i dont resonate with but here it is regardless. i dont really _get_ it ig.

- vectors - can be anything as long as there is an addition and a multiplication operation possible.(Multiplication by a number). ok this is abstracting away from the representation. this way it can be thought of as having a purpose.

**think of vectors as the 1st idea in a coordinate system with its tail(the part without the arrow) rooted at the origin**

the goal is to understand concepts using this coordinate plane idea and then transfer that to the list of numbers idea.

know this idea already. how to represent vectors in a cordinate plane.

[coordinateAxe1 coordinateAxe2 coordinateAxe3 coordinateAxe4 ...] -> Number of coordinate Axes -> Dimensions
[x y] -> 2D
[x y z] -> 3D

this addition of vectors visualization is cool.

#### COOL IDEA ALERT!!
think of vectors as movement in space with a direction and a magnitude.

![vector-movement](/media/3b1b-la-vector-movement.gif "vectors as a movement in space and their addition")

same idea can be applied to the number line obv

[x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub>] + [x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>2</sub>] = [x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>1</sub>+y<sub>2</sub>]

multiplication of a vector by a number is streching the vector if the number is >1, shrinking the vector if the number is <1 and the same for negative numbers but the vector is flipped first.

![vector-multiplication](/media/3b1b-la-vector-multiplication.gif "vector multiplication aka scaling")

this operation can be called scaling (for obvious reasons) and the number which scales the vector is called a **_scaler_**!
throughout linear algebra one of the most common things numbers do is scale vectors. so scaler <-> number

2[x y] -> [2x 2y]
