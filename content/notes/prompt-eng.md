_tested with text-davinci-003 using OpenAI's playground(opens in a new tab) unless otherwise specified. The model uses the default configurations, i.e., temperature=0.7 and top-p=1_

### Knobs

- Temperature: higher value -> more deterministic output. lower value -> more creative output (_higher chances of hallucination?_). **essentially increasing the weights of other possible tokens!** as temperature decreases
