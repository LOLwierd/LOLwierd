_**accelerate!**_

ok wtf just realised before diving into AI i need to learn linear algebra. that slows me down considerably.
* [ ] finish watching [3Blue1Brown: Linear Alg](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) (maybe if i finish this i can go through the course parallely or skip it altogether ðŸ¤· )
* [ ] start watching [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) (figure out if i can go through this parallely. _if not this will add weeks!_)
