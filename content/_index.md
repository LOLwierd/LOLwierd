### getting better

> shamelessly stole [yacine's](https://yacine.ca/) whole fucking flow

**rough plan**
get a tour of the landscape while building the foundational knowledge (mainly linear algebra), then try to get hands on (not building obv, but maybe some fine tuning, developing embeddings, langchain, etc). will decide next steps after i get an overall feel of the area, but ideally would like to get an understanding of how they work next (we'll see how the prior steps go first though ðŸ™ƒ)

_**accelerate!**_

* [ ] read [Waterfall diagrams and relative odds](https://arbital.com/p/bayes_waterfall_diagram/?l=1x1&pathId=93949)

ok wtf just realised before diving into AI i need to learn linear algebra. that slows me down considerably.
* [ ] finish watching [3B1B: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) (maybe if i finish this i can go through the course parallely or skip it altogether ðŸ¤· ). [notes]({{<ref "/notes/3b1b-la.md">}} "notes") 
* [ ] start watching [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) (figure out if i can go through this parallely. _if not this will add weeks!_ figure out a shortcut! if no exist no shortcut me big sad). [notes]({{<ref "/notes/prompt-eng.md">}} "notes")

* [ ] chill watch [Neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) (no need to take notes, this is revision)

* [ ] read [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)
* [ ] read [The Complete Beginners Guide To Autonomous Agents](https://www.mattprd.com/p/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-autonomous-agents) 
* [ ] read [What Is ChatGPT Doing â€¦ and Why Does It Work?â€”Stephen Wolfram Writings](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/)

* [ ] read [How to train your own Large Language Models](https://blog.replit.com/llm-training)
* [ ] watch [State of GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A) (its ok if no understand will come back to this. 1st watch mostly for getting a feel)

too much of a pussy to start reading papers. need some foundational knowledege and confidence

* [ ] skim and recognize holes [LLM Introduction: Learn Language Models](https://gist.github.com/rain-1/eebd5e5eb2784feecf450324e3341c8d)
* [ ] skim and recognize holes [swyxio/ai-notes](https://github.com/swyxio/ai-notes/tree/main#top-ai-reads)
