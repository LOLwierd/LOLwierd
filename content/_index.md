i have time now, back on the grind. have a lot to catch up, lfg.

# week of june 12th
- started a new job, made very slow turtle like progress in linear algebra and prompt engineering. 
- will need to find time.

# week of june 19th
_**accelerate!**_

ok wtf just realised before diving into AI i need to learn linear algebra. that slows me down considerably.
* [ ] finish watching [3B1B: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) (maybe if i finish this i can go through the course parallely or skip it altogether ðŸ¤· ). [notes]({{<ref "/notes/3b1b-la.md">}} "notes") 
* [ ] start watching [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) (figure out if i can go through this parallely. _if not this will add weeks!_ figure out a shortcut! if no exist shortcut me big sad).
