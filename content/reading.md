### [The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/systems-view-of-life/35186BA5B12161E469C4224B6076ADFE)

i'll try and do something very ambitious.

### [The Art of Computer Programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)
> yaa i get why this is supposed to be hard.

## Papers 
~~Slacking quite a bit here~~. pretty much on pause tbh.
### [SQLite: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p3535-gaffney.pdf)

### [Out of the Tar Pit](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)

### [Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf)
Cool paper. The interesting part was their compression algorithm and their in memory DS. Read it as a part of my work, but figured halfway we can't allow one of its core assumptions which makes the compression algorithm soo effective.
[Clickhouse has an implementation of this internally.](https://altinity.com/blog/2019-7-new-encodings-to-improve-clickhouse)

### [What goes around comes around](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yanlei/courses/CS691LL-f06/papers/SH05.pdf)
Cool paper. Had some alpha. Read a little like a history lesson. Learnt quite a bit.

### [The Five-Minute Rule Ten Years Later, and Other Computer Storage Rules of Thumb](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~natassa/courses/15-721/papers/gray.pdf)
Kinda old. actually very old. most of the shit here is not actually applicable today, cause the core assumptions just aren't true anymore. we've accelerated far too ahead.
Had some fun reading it nonetheless.
