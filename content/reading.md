## Books
i really want to learn more about history. i feel like i dont know enough and i should. starting with biographies of cool people.
~~also getting an overall feel for the historical timeline including prehistory from yt vids and articles.~~
Also i haven't really read the western classics when i was small. they had panchtantra, aesops fables and all at my library. So thats on my mind too.

## Papers
Slacking quite a bit here.
### [SQLite: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p3535-gaffney.pdf)
got the rec from twitter. started reading it like a week ago and haven't touched it since. need to get back on it.

### [Out of the Tar Pit](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)
a hefty boi. read like 2 sections. reads like a history lesson. bunch of things i knew, made a bunch of connections.

### [Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf)
Cool paper. The interesting part was their compression algorithm and their in memory DS. Read it as a part of my work, but figured halfway we can't allow one of its core assumptions which makes the compression algorithm soo effective.

### [What goes around comes around](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yanlei/courses/CS691LL-f06/papers/SH05.pdf)
Cool paper. Had some alpha. Read a little like a history lesson. Learnt quite a bit.

### [The Five-Minute Rule Ten Years Later, and Other Computer Storage Rules of Thumb](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~natassa/courses/15-721/papers/gray.pdf)
Kinda old. actually very old. most of the shit here is not actually applicable today, cause the core assumptions just aren't true anymore. we've accelerated far too ahead.
Had some fun reading it nonetheless.
